# Workspace Management - Implementation Tasks

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Setup
- [ ] Create `Workspace` entity with required properties
- [ ] Create `WorkspaceMember` entity for role-based access
- [ ] Create `WorkspaceInvitation` entity with token and status tracking
- [ ] Set up EF Core configurations and relationships
- [ ] Configure indexes for invitation tokens and email lookups
- [ ] Create and apply initial database migrations

### 2. API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement workspace CRUD endpoints
  - [ ] `POST /api/workspaces` - Create workspace
  - [ ] `GET /api/workspaces` - List workspaces
  - [ ] `GET /api/workspaces/{id}` - Get workspace details
  - [ ] `PUT /api/workspaces/{id}` - Update workspace
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}` - Delete workspace

- [ ] Implement member management endpoints
  - [ ] `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/members` - List members
  - [ ] `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/members` - Add member
  - [ ] `PUT /api/workspaces/{id}/members/{userId}` - Update role
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}/members/{userId}` - Remove member

- [ ] Implement invitation endpoints
  - [ ] `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/invite` - Send invitation
  - [ ] `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/invitations` - List pending invitations
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}/invitations/{invitationId}` - Cancel invitation

### 3. Business Logic
- [ ] Implement `WorkspaceService` with core operations
- [ ] Implement `PermissionService` for access control
- [ ] Implement `InvitationService` with methods for:
  - [ ] Generating secure invitation tokens
  - [ ] Sending invitation emails
  - [ ] Validating invitation tokens
  - [ ] Processing invitation acceptances
  - [ ] Handling invitation expiration
  - [ ] Resending invitations
- [ ] Add validation logic for workspace operations
- [ ] Implement workspace statistics and metrics
- [ ] Add cleanup job for expired invitations

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Workspace List View
- [ ] Create workspace list component

- [ ] Add create workspace modal
- [ ] Add search and filter functionality
- [ ] Implement workspace sorting options

### 2. Workspace Detail View
- [ ] Create workspace dashboard
- [ ] Implement member list with role management
- [ ] Add settings panel
- [ ] Implement activity feed
- [ ] Add workspace statistics display

### 3. Member Management
- [ ] Create member list component
- [ ] Implement invite member flow
- [ ] Add role management UI
- [ ] Implement member search and filtering
- [ ] Add bulk actions for members

### 4. Invitation System
- [ ] Create invitation list component with filtering
- [ ] Implement invitation form with role selection
- [ ] Add invitation status tracking with visual indicators
- [ ] Create invitation acceptance flow with account creation
- [ ] Implement invitation expiration handling and notifications
- [ ] Add resend invitation functionality
- [ ] Implement invitation revocation
- [ ] Add bulk invitation handling

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests

- [ ] Test role-based invitation permissions

### 3. E2E Tests
- [ ] Test workspace creation flow
- [ ] Test member invitation and management
- [ ] Test permission scenarios
- [ ] Test error cases

## Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guide for workspace management
- [ ] Developer documentation for integration
- [ ] API examples and use cases

## Security
- [ ] Implement row-level security for invitations
- [ ] Add audit logging for invitation operations
- [ ] Test for common security vulnerabilities in invitation flow
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for invitation endpoints
- [ ] Add token expiration and one-time use enforcement
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection for invitation endpoints
- [ ] Add email verification for new accounts from invitations

## Performance
