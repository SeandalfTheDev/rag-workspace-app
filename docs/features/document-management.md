# Document Management

## Overview
The Document Management system is a core component of Clevor Docs that handles the entire lifecycle of documents within workspaces. It supports multiple file formats, versioning, and organizes documents in a workspace context.

## Key Features
- Upload and store various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown)
- Track document status and metadata
- Organize documents within workspaces
- Support for document versioning
- Document preview and basic editing
- Bulk operations on multiple documents

## Core Components

### 1. Entities

#### Document
- **Purpose**: Represents an uploaded document and its metadata
- **Key Properties**:
  - `Id`: Unique identifier
  - `WorkspaceId`: Parent workspace
  - `FileName`: Original filename
  - `FileType`: Document format
  - `FileSize`: Size in bytes
  - `Status`: Processing state
  - `StoragePath`: Physical storage location
  - `Metadata`: Additional document properties

#### DocumentChunk
- **Purpose**: Represents a processed segment of a document
- **Key Properties**:
  - `DocumentId`: Parent document reference
  - `ChunkIndex`: Position in document
  - `Content`: Text content
  - `PageNumber`: Source page (for paginated formats)
  - `VectorEmbedding`: Semantic vector representation

### 2. Services

#### DocumentUploadService
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle file uploads and validation
  - Manage temporary storage during upload
  - Generate unique filenames and paths

#### DocumentProcessingService
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Extract text from different file formats
  - Split content into manageable chunks
  - Generate document metadata
  - Update document status

#### DocumentSearchService
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Index document content
  - Handle search queries
  - Return relevant document chunks

### 3. API Endpoints

```http
# Document Management
POST   /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents/upload  # Upload document
GET    /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents         # List documents
GET    /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents/{id}    # Get document
PUT    /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents/{id}    # Update document
DELETE /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents/{id}    # Delete document

# Document Content
GET    /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents/{id}/content  # Download
GET    /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents/{id}/preview  # Generate preview

# Document Processing
POST   /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents/{id}/process  # Trigger processing
GET    /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents/{id}/chunks   # List chunks
```

## Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Document Upload Flow
1. User initiates file upload through the UI
2. File is uploaded in chunks to handle large files
3. Document record is created with 'Uploading' status
4. On successful upload, status changes to 'Processing'
5. Background worker processes the document
6. Once processed, status updates to 'Ready'

### 2. Document Processing Pipeline
1. Document is retrieved from storage
2. Appropriate processor extracts text content
3. Content is split into logical chunks
4. Each chunk is processed for vector embeddings
5. Chunks and embeddings are stored in the database
6. Document metadata is updated

### 3. Document Retrieval
1. User requests a document or performs a search
2. System verifies workspace permissions
3. Document metadata and content are retrieved
4. For searches, relevant chunks are identified using vector similarity
5. Results are formatted and returned

## Frontend Components

### DocumentUploader.razor
- Drag-and-drop interface for file uploads
- Progress tracking for uploads
- File type validation
- Multiple file support

### DocumentList.razor
- Tabular view of documents
- Sorting and filtering options
- Bulk actions menu
- Status indicators

### DocumentViewer.razor
- Document preview renderer
- Page navigation
- Zoom and rotation controls
- Text selection and copying

## Security Considerations
- File type validation to prevent malicious uploads
- Size limits on uploads
- Access control at workspace level
- Secure storage of documents
- Virus scanning integration

## Performance Considerations
- Chunked uploads for large files
- Background processing for resource-intensive operations
- Caching of frequently accessed documents
- Efficient indexing for search performance
- Lazy loading of document content

## Error Handling
- Clear error messages for upload failures
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Logging of processing errors
- Notification system for failed operations

## Integration Points
- Workspace system for access control
- Vector search for semantic search capabilities
- Chat system for document-based conversations
- User activity tracking for audit trails
