# Vector Search

## Overview
The Vector Search system powers the semantic search capabilities of Clevor Docs, enabling users to find information based on meaning rather than just keywords. It leverages modern embedding models and efficient vector similarity search to deliver relevant results.

## Key Features
- Semantic search across document collections
- Hybrid search combining vector and keyword matching
- Relevance scoring and result ranking
- Filtering by metadata and document properties
- Support for multiple embedding models
- Incremental indexing
- Query expansion and refinement

## Core Components

### 1. Embedding Models

#### Model Management
- **Supported Models**:
  - OpenAI embeddings
  - Ollama local models
  - Custom model integration
- **Model Selection**:
  - Performance vs. accuracy tradeoffs
  - Dimensionality configuration
  - Batch processing support

#### Embedding Service
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Text to vector conversion
  - Batch processing of documents
  - Model versioning and updates
  - Dimensionality reduction

### 2. Search Infrastructure

#### Vector Store
- **Storage Backend**:
  - PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
  - Efficient vector similarity search
  - Support for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
  - Index management and optimization

#### Indexing Service
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Document chunk indexing
  - Incremental updates
  - Index optimization
  - Statistics collection

### 3. Search API

#### Search Service
- **Search Types**:
  - Pure vector search
  - Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
  - Filtered search
  - Faceted search
- **Features**:
  - Query expansion
  - Result highlighting
  - Snippet generation
  - Relevance tuning

## API Endpoints

```http
# Search Operations
POST   /api/search/vector           # Vector similarity search
POST   /api/search/hybrid           # Hybrid vector + keyword search
GET    /api/search/models            # List available models
GET    /api/search/status           # Indexing status

# Index Management
POST   /api/search/index            # Add/update documents in index
DELETE /api/search/index/{id}       # Remove document from index
POST   /api/search/index/batch      # Bulk index operations
POST   /api/search/index/optimize   # Optimize index
```

## Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. Document Indexing
1. Processed document chunks are received
2. Text content is converted to vector embeddings
3. Vectors are stored with document metadata
4. Search index is updated
5. Index statistics are refreshed

### 2. Search Execution
1. User submits search query
2. Query is preprocessed and expanded
3. Query is converted to vector
4. Similar vectors are retrieved from the database
5. Results are ranked and filtered
6. Snippets and highlights are generated
7. Response is formatted and returned

### 3. Performance Optimization
1. Query planning and optimization
2. Result caching
3. Parallel execution
4. Resource management

## Integration Points

### With Document Processing
- New document ingestion
- Document updates and deletions
- Processing status updates

### With Chat System
- Context retrieval for RAG
- Citation generation
- Source attribution

### With User Interface
- Search result display
- Facet filtering
- Result highlighting

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Performance
